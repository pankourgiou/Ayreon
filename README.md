# Through_fire_and_steel
This is a bot or not implementation. It's written in python and on the issues folder there are 4 .odt files in Kaotican, Zoran, Hylian and Gerudo languages. The 3 new languages that we show here will be called Christina 5,6,7 and they are based on python programming using Zoran, Hylian, Gerundo and 23 more languages. The program is simple but someone must be able to understand if the poem is written from a robot or a human.
